<a name="order_products"></a>
## [HOWTO] Order products in list layout
The product list layout by default takes the ordering in the Article Manager. However, you can change this ordering (on page load / refresh) via the Menu Parameters.

NOTE: This tutorial applies only for those using the J2Store's Product List Layout in Version 3. If you use the default article layouts, refer the Joomla documentation on ordering of articles.

Login to Joomla administration and open the menu that links your product list.

Under the Common Options tab, you can find Article Order parameter. There you can choose the ordering method.

## [HOWTO] solve jQuery conflict with Multi-categories component

If you are using the Multi-cateogies component (which adds the ability to choose more than one category for your articles), you might experience a jQuery conflict with J2Store. Here is a quick fix

Are you using Multi-categories component ?
If yes, then the issue comes due to loading of multiple Jquery UI instances.

Here is a quick fix

Open /administrator/components/com_j2store/helpers/strapper.php

Around line 33, you will find

$document->addScript(JURI::root(true).'/media/j2store/js/j2storejqui.js');

Change this to

if($mainframe->isSite()) {$document->addScript(JURI::root(true).'/media/j2store/js/j2storejqui.js');}

Save.
Logout. Clear browser cache and test.
This should fix the issue.

## Selling Digital Goods Online with J2Store

Selling ebooks, PDF, images and files online is easy with the J2Store Joomla shopping cart. Here is a step-by-step guide to set up your digital downloads.

#### Step 1: Let us create a folder on your site to upload the files

You can use your Hosting Providers CPanel File manager or an FTP client like FileZilla to access your web root (public_html / www / httpdocs )

Once you are in the web root, create a folder. Let us name it as: myfiles

#### Step 2: Protect the folder from outside access

**We do not want people to access this folder using their browser and download files. So let us protect this folder using a .htaccess file.**

Create a file called htaccess.txt in your computer and open it with your favorite text editor
Add the following lines to it

order deny, allow
deny form all

Save the file. Now upload it to the folder we just have created in our web root. In our example, it is **myfiles**

**IMPORTANT:** Rename it as .htaccess

All the files uploaded to this folder is now protected.

#### Step 3: Point J2Store to use the files in this folder.

Go to Joomla admin - j2store - Configuration - Basic settings.

In Folder path for digital goods, enter the name of the folder that contains your files. In our example, it is: myfiles

Save the configuration.

#### Step 4: Creating your first digital product

J2Store uses Joomla articles as products. So head to Joomla admin -> Article Manager and create an article.

Fill in the title, description, add an image and set all other fields and Save.

Go to J2Store cart tab and set all the fields and Save.

Now go to files tab in the navigation you can see Set product files button.

<a name="missing_currency_symbol"></a>
## Solving the missing currency symbol in your store

When you install, J2Store sets USD as the default currency. When store owners change the currency code, they often forgot to update their default currency in their store profile.

When you see the currency symbol missing, it is an indication that:

1. You have either changed the currency code or deleted the USD and then created a new currency for your country.

2. You forgot to reflect these changes in the Store profile.

Solution
Go to J2Store admin -> Set up - > -> configuration -> Store

Choose your Default Currency.

**IMPORTANT:**Hit the Save button. Even if you see your currency is selected by default, it may not be saved in the store profile database. Since it is the only currency available (you deleted the USD or any other currency), the dropdown list shows the first currency available.

So CLICK the SAVE button.

Still not seeing the Currency symbol, open your store again and click SAVE again.

<a name="joomsef"></a>
## Joom SEF configuration for J2Store

If you are using JoomSEF along with J2Store, you will need to make simple change in the configuration.

Go to JoomSEF configuration -> Advanced Configuration. Change the Set Page base href value to Yes - always use only base URL.

<a name="remove_prefix"></a>
## How to Remove + and - Prefix in Product Option Price

Store owners sometimes want to hide the + (PLUS) and the - (MINUS) prefix that is shown along with the product options. In J2Store Version 3, you turn off the price prefix with a switch.

#### Default Joomla article layouts (like Category blog layout):

Go to J2Store - Configuration - Product tab.

Set Product option price prefix to HIDE

Save
![](./assets/images/priceprefix_1.png)
#### Product list layout:

If you use the J2Store's product list layout, then you will find a similar switch in the menu parameters.

Open the menu that links your product list layout and go to Common Options.

Set Product option price prefix to HIDE

Save

<a name="translate_addr_fields"></a>
## HOW To Translate the Address Field Labels

If you wanted to translate the Address field labels, you can enter your translation in the respective fields.
Go to Joomla admin -> J2Store -> Set up -> Custom Fields

Open the field, the label of which you want to change, and enter your translation in the label field.

#### Multi-lingual sites

if you are running multi-lingual site, you can enter a language constant in the label field.
Example: J2STORE_MY_FIELD_NAME

Then you can go to Language manager and create an Override
**IMPORTANT: Set the Filter to Administrator before you create an override.**

Click New

Language Constant: J2STORE_MY_FIELD_NAME

Text: Your translation

Check the For Both locations

Save.
![](./assets/images/translation_addres_fields.png)

You can repeat this steps for your second, third, and other languages.

You can use language strings in all the fields including Custom Error message, Option Titles (if field type is select, radio, checkbox).

<a name="color_cart_button"></a>
## HOW TO change the colour of add to cart buttons

A majority of those who wanted to change the colour of the buttons are using template with a template that does not support the Twitter bootstrap framework, which helps you make your site responsive.

We have added a name-spaced bootstrap css in the J2Store package. So if your template does not support bootstrap, J2Store will use the bootstrap CSS included in the package. If your template supports bootstrap, then J2Store will inherit your template style, without you changing any CSS.

The following is a guide to those who want to change the button colours

Open your template's css file located in /templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/css folder.

At the end of the file, add the following CSS. Save the file. Clean your browser cache and joomla cache. Refresh.

#### Add to cart button
```css
.j2store .btn-primary {background: #FF0000 !important; /*this will change your button colour to red. You can change the hex colour code based on your choice */

color: #FFFFFF !important; /*this will change your text on the button to white. You can change the hex colour code based on your choice */

}
```

#### View cart button
```css
.j2store .btn-success {

background: #FF0000 !important;

color: #FFFFFF !important;

}

.j2store .btn-success:hover {

background: #FF0000 !important;

color: #FFFFFF !important;

}
```

#### Update button

```css
.j2store .btn-warning {

background: #FF0000 !important;

color: #FFFFFF !important;

}

.j2store .btn-warning:hover {

background: #FF0000 !important;

color: #FFFFFF !important;

}
```

## Writing a Layout override for Joomla article manager - An intro image

Layout overrides is a feature introduced in Joomla 3. They provide more modularity for templates across views and avoid duplication of code for a same design.

Consider a situation In Joomla caregory blog layout, you have to make a Joomla Article intro image a hyperlink with the read more button link. If you are using prostar template you can use this below.

#### Step 1: Write a layout override

You can use a file manager in your Hosting Control panel or an FTP client like FileZilla for doing the following tasks.

Copy

JOOMLA-ROOT/layouts/joomla/content/intro_image.php


to

JOOMLA-ROOT/templates/<YOUR_TEMPLATE>/html/layouts/joomla/content/intro_image.php

#### Step 2: Edit the override layout

Find below code

```php
$params = $displayData->params; 
?> 
<?php $images = json_decode($displayData->images); ?>

<?php if (isset($images->image_intro) && !empty($images->image_intro)) : ?>

<?php $imgfloat = (empty($images->float_intro)) ? $params->get('float_intro') : $images->float_intro; ?>

<div class="pull-<?php echo htmlspecialchars($imgfloat); ?> item-image"> <img

<?php if ($images->image_intro_caption): echo 'class="caption"' . ' title="' . htmlspecialchars($images->image_intro_caption) . '"'; endif; ?> src="/<?php echo htmlspecialchars($images->image_intro); ?>" alt="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($images->image_intro_alt); ?>" itemprop="thumbnailUrl"/> </div>

<?php endif; ?> 
```

Replace above code with following code

```php
$params  = $displayData->params;
    if ($params->get('access-view')) :
		$link = JRoute::_(ContentHelperRoute::getArticleRoute($displayData->slug, $displayData->catid));
	else :
		$menu = JFactory::getApplication()->getMenu();
		$active = $menu->getActive();
		$itemId = $active->id;
		$link1 = JRoute::_('index.php?option=com_users&view=login&Itemid=' . $itemId);
		$returnURL = JRoute::_(ContentHelperRoute::getArticleRoute($displayData->item->slug, $displayData->item->catid));
		$link = new JUri($link1);
		$link->setVar('return', base64_encode($returnURL));
	endif;
?>
<?php $images = json_decode($displayData->images); ?>
<?php if (isset($images->image_intro) && !empty($images->image_intro)) : ?>
	<?php $imgfloat = (empty($images->float_intro)) ? $params->get('float_intro') : $images->float_intro; ?>
	<div class="pull-<?php echo htmlspecialchars($imgfloat); ?> item-image"> 
	<a href="/<?php echo $link; ?>">
	<img
	<?php if ($images->image_intro_caption):
		echo 'class="caption"' . ' title="' . htmlspecialchars($images->image_intro_caption) . '"';
	endif; ?> src="/<?php echo htmlspecialchars($images->image_intro); ?>" alt="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($images->image_intro_alt); ?>" itemprop="thumbnailUrl"/>
	</a>
	 </div>
<?php endif; ?>

#### HOWTO solve javascript conflict between some of RocketTheme templates and J2Store

If you are using a RocketTheme template with the RokBox plugin, then you might have experienced a javascript conflict at the checkout steps.

One of our users Joe from Jgpproductions.com found the solution:

The rokbox has a new version RokBox2  and there is an option to use "backward compatibility"  that can be found in the plug in settings
```
If users take the steps to upgrade RokBox2 "correctly" and then turn off the "backward" option then J2store checkout steps will work good.
```
You can find the details to update rokBox here http://www.rockettheme.com/extensions-joomla/rokbox click on the DOCUMENTATION link on the right to get all the details on how to correct rokBox in older templates
```
NOTE: If you are upgrading from RokBox1 and you are using the old RokBox syntax, such as {rokbox} or <a rel="rokbox" >.., you can enable the Backward Compatibility from both the System and Content plug-in. You will also have to enable Backward Compatibility if you are using the Login or Module Popup Feature in any of our templates prior to Alerion. Those templates will be updated over time to be compatible with RokBox2 over time.
Be aware that the Backward compatibility can dramatically slow down the loading of your site. It is highly suggested to convert the old syntax into the new one.

<a name="enable_ssl"></a>
## HOW TO set up and enable SSL in Joomla?

Most of the Joomla web shop owners want their site to be secure. By installing and enabling SSL in Joomla,

you can protect your site and your customers from some exploits. When you are running an e-commerce site, you will be getting customer information that has to be kept confidential.

Adding an SSL certificate and enabling it on your Joomla! site will allow customers to log in with the secure “https” protocol instead of the standard “http” prefix. You can turn SSL on for Administrators only,  for the whole site (recommended) or selected pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You should request your Web Hosting Provider to install and enable the SSL certificate before you follow the steps mentioned below.

#### Method 1: Enabling SSL for the entire site

Navigate to Global Configuration -> Server -> Force SSL : Entire site. Click Apply/Save. This will force SSL for your entire website, both Administrator and front end.
If you don’t have SSL enabled for your domain name, you will immediately get an error upon saving.

Please note!: The Joomla!  global configuration allows you to configure SSL, but if a visitor enters a Joomla!  page through non-HTTPS (I mean “old” URLs), this visitor is not automatically redirected.

Using a text editor open the configuration.php file from your site and find this line,
var $live_site =”;

Replace it with:

```php
var $live_site = 'https://www.your-site.com';
```
Then go to your .htaccess file and add these lines to the end of the file:

```php
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
```

#### SSL for selected pages

You would have to use a plugin to enable SSL for selected pages. There is a couple of plugins that makes the job easy for you. Yireo SSL Redirection plugin is one of them. You get the plugin from [here](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension/site-management/url-redirection/yireo-ssl-redirection)

Before experimenting with SSL, please keep in mind that it may affect your site loading speed. Because, serving HTTPS traffic costs more in resources than HTTP requests.

NOTE: If you are using the Yiero plugin, then you should include the J2Store component for SSL. Otherwise you might face issues.

The following article published in the Joomla Magazine throws light on the advantages and disadvantages of SSL. Read it before you implement SSL in your website. [Read it](http://magazine.joomla.org/issues/issue-jan-2013/item/1023-how-ssl-can-secure-and-add-features-to-your-joomla-site)

## How to add your business logo to the invoice and email template ?

Many of you tried adding image in your invoice and email template text editor, but it fails to show it in order invoice and email.
