the following, in this order:

    * currencyiso3a
    * mainamount
    * sitereference
    * settlestatus
    * settleduedate
    * PASSWORD *

'Site Security' is now enabled.  Remember to never tell any other individuals your Site Security Password.  Do not store hard copies of this password anywhere.

*The last field, 'PASSWORD', is to be the combination of characters you entered into the 'Site Security Password'.

It is highly recommended that you enable the notification hash.  See section 2.3 for more information on the notification script itself.

To enable the notification hash you will firstly have to enter a 'Security Password' in the 'Destination' window of the MyST Notification page (see section 2.3).
