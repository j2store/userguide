# Options

In this page, the information to add new custom options are given.

#### Unique Name
A unique name should be given for every option since ambiguity should not arise out of that. Otherwise, if two options have same name, things would mess up.

#### Display / Presentation
What is given here will be displayed for that option.

#### Type
There are 9 types of options available in J2Store. Of the 9, 3 options have multiple option values. Here is how it goes...

1. Dropdown
2. Radio
3. Checkbox

**Dropdown** will have a select list and the available options will be listed. Usually only one option is selected from the list.

* E.g., if a country is to be selected from a list, one can select only one from the list.

**Radio** In this option, all the available options will be shown in the screen and only one option can be selected.

* E.g., to choose the sex of a person, normally **Radio** buttons are used and obviously only one can be selected at a time.

**Checkbox** This option provides facility to select multiple options at a time.

* E.g., if the products are listed and asked to select, multiple check boxes can be checked simultaneously to select the products.

If these options are selected from the list, then a new row of fields will appear to enter the option values for the selected option. Any number of option values can be added to the selected option.
