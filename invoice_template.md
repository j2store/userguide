### Creating / Editing Invoice template in PRO version
Like email template, here too we have two settings pages to be filled up for creating an invoice template. They are
* Basic
* Advanced

The following points reveal the process of an invoice template.

#### Basic
The fundamental requirements of a template. Let us see one by one.

#### Title
The title of the template. You can have as many templates as you like and hence it necessary to give a unique title to each and every template.

#### Order Status
Invoice will be generated based on the order status only. To generate an invoice, the orderstatus should be **'COMPLETED'**.

#### Language
Here you can select for which particular language this template can be used or for all the languages.

#### Groups
This states that which group can generate an invoice for e.g., groups like Administrator, Manager, Editor etc. can be able to generate invoices whereas public and guest user groups can not do so. This can be determined using this field.

#### Payment Methods
This defines the payment methods that are accepted for selling. Some payment options may not be accepted by some sellers and they may wish to avoid those options. For that it has been enabled to select the options from the available list.

#### Status
For a template to be used for invoicing, it has to be published prior to that. This field will notify that status.

#### Advanced
In advanced settings, we have the invoice content. The content of the invoice can be designed here. You can include a lot of information. There is a rich text editor to neatly customize the content. 

Using the short codes, you can add customer name, order no, order date, payment details, shipping details, product details etc. This is can be accomplished by adding suitable tags listed in the extreme right area of the page.

Check the image below for how an invoice template can be designed for our needs. This is for example purpose only and the user can design his/her own template.

### How to add custom fields in invoice template?

Also, you can add custom fields you have created in the editor. To add a custom field in the editor for display, you need to follow the format given below:

[CUSTOM_BILLING_FIELD:FIELDNAME]

Keep in mind, the following, when you add a custom field to the editor:

* The custom field should be enclosed in []
* All the letters should be in CAPITAL letters
* 'CUSTOM' is the first word inside the []
* Next, the section in which you have created the field, like, 'BILLING_FIELD'
* And finally, the field name

Refer the image below for more clear understanding.
