# Show J2Store content in Front-end

This section will help you understand how to display the SEBLOD article in front end.

The display can be achieved in the following methods:

* **Category Blog View**
* **Single Article View**
* **Search & List View**

To display SEBLOD articles in the frontend, you need to create a menu exclusively and then you can display it. 

### Category Blog View
Before you proceed to view the article in frontend, you need to check one thing. Go to **Components -> J2Store -> Setup -> Configuration**. Go to **Cart** tab. Now, check the setting of **Add to cart placement** option. Ensure it is selected with **Within article using tag** as shown in the image below.

If the settings match the image above, you are done. If there is no ***J2Store_Cart*** listed on the left side, you can create on using the **+** sign on the right side. Now go to the frontend. All the articles will be listed in the site, as shown in the image below:
