#### How to setup pricing for subscription product ?

- **Subscription price :** Enter the membership price (for example, $29) based on either daily or weekly or monthly or yearly basis.

   For example, if you would like to give subscription price $29 for only 3 months, then enter $29 in the first text box and then choose **every 3rd** from the dropdown list and then choose **month** from third dropdown list.

- **Subscription length :** The subscription length duration will be listed based on the recurring period you selected above.  For example, if your subscription product's duration period is only for 3 months, Choose 3 months. So the subscription will end at the  end of 3rd month.

  If you would like to give a life time price for your subscription product (i.e.) wants to collect $29 at the end of every 3 months for lifetime, choose **Never Expire** to Subscription length. So $29 for every 3rd month for lifetime.

- **Add / Remove user groups :** Users will be added and removed from the Joomla user groups when their subscription to the level is enabled or disabled.

- **Sign-up fee :** This app allows you to collect one time set up fee or sign up fee from your customers. Enter your sign up fee here. For example, $5 or $10.

- **Free trial** Using Free Trial you can set the number of days the subscription can be on trial mode. Once the trial days are over, the app automatically converts it to an active subscription and attempts to process the first payment.

- **Renewal discount :** If you wants to give the same discount to the customer during renewals. Checking this checkbox will override any renewal discount set globally in the app settings.

- **Set Advanced Pricing :** If you want advanced pricing, click the 'Set Prices' button and it will open up a pop-up window to allow you to set an advanced price setting.
