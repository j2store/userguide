This page describes about the product types, how to create them etc.

In J2Store, products are classified into four types namely,

1. **[Simple](http://j2store.gitbooks.io/user-guide/content/#simple_product.html)**
2. **[Variable](http://j2store.gitbooks.io/user-guide/content/variable_product.html)**
3. **[Configurable](http://j2store.gitbooks.io/user-guide/content/configurable_product.html)**
4. **[Downloadable](http://j2store.gitbooks.io/user-guide/content/downloadable_product.html)**

Based on the type of the product, the data and the options associated with the product will vary. Each one explained exclusively.
