# Weight based per order

This type of shipping is calculating the cost based on the total weight of the order items. If a cost of $ 10.00 is charged for weights upto 50 Kilograms, and $ 20.00 is charged for total weights between 51 and 100 Kilograms, then an order having a total weight of 70 kilograms will attract a shipping cost of $ 20.00.

Configure this shipping method as explained in the image below:

As in the previous shipping methods, you need to give a **Shipping Method Name**, select a **Tax Profile**, **Enable** the method, and more importantly, select the type to be '**Weight based per order**'. And if necessary you can select the **Override Shipping Address** option. Enter **Minimum** and **Maximum** subtotals required for shipping.

And that's it.
