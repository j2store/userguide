# Flat rate per order

A fixed rate will be charged for every order. For e.g., if the shipping cost is levied at $ 50.00 for every order, then the shipping cost is set to $ 0.00. This type of shipping can be termed as Store Pickup Method or Free Shipping Method.

See the image below on how to configure this shipping type.
