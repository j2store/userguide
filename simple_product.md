## Introduction
A most common product type. It suits the requirements of most of the store owners.

You can create a simple product with or without product options. The inventory for this product type is managed for the primary product (Not for the options). All option types can be associated with the simple product.

### Pricing
Add the price of your product. Depending on your requirement, you can also choose to configure an advanced pricing from here.

Now, check the image below:

![Simple Product Pricing](./assets/images/product_simple_pricing.png)

As illustrated in the image, you can set the regular price by entering the value in the text box. If you want advanced pricing, click the '**Set Prices**' button and it will open up a pop-up window to allow you to set an advanced price setting.

Let us see how it happens. Check the image below:

![Simple Product Add Pricing](./assets/images/product_simple_add_pricing.png)

* Select the dates (optional), between which you wish to set the advanced price. *This option is not mandatory. For instance, you can offer a special price throughout the year, for a bulk purchase.* 

* Quantity range for this price to apply. This is also optional and if there is no minimum quantity required, just leave it as empty.

* Select the customer group to which you offer this special price. Default: Public

* Now enter the special price and click **Create**.

The price will be added and displayed below. You can edit that if you need, and click **Save all prices**.

If you want to remove that, you can do it by clicking the **Remove** button.


<a name="inventory"></a>
### Inventory

#### * This is J2Store PRO exclusive feature *

This tab has the configuration setup facility for inventory management. Here you can set the following details with respect to inventory. Check the image below:

![Simple Inventory](./assets/images/product_simple_inventory.png)

From the image you can understand the following:

* **Manage Stock** - To enable Stock Management - Select **Yes**
* **Stock Quantity** - Enter the initial stock quantity
* **Allow Backorders** - Choose from the options whether or not to allow backorders to customers, i.e., the customer can order a product even if there is no stock
    * **Allow but notify customers** - The second option would allow customer to purchase a product even if it is not in stock.
A message will appear (a notification) before the price stating that: This item can be backordered
![](./assets/images/backorder-notify.png)

This comes from the language file.
The constant is: J2STORE_BACKORDER_NOTIFICATION

You can write a language override for this constant and display a customized message.

NOTE: This notification will display if:
- Stock is 0

This option is for those who sell fast moving products. So even if a product stock reaches 0, the customers could still order.

* **Stock Status** - Select stock status i.e., **In stock** or **Out of stock**
* **Notify if stock goes below** - Set minimum stock level for low stock alert
* **Quantity Restriction** - Choose whether purchase quantity is restricted and if Yes, set the limits for minimum and maximum quantity for a purchase by entering the quantities in the fields provided
* **Use store configuration** - If you select '**Use store configuration**', you cannot enter max and min quantity fields, as they will be disabled

<a name="images"></a>
### Images
In this tab you can add images that can help the customer to understand more clearly, the product he wants to buy. Images help the prospect to imagine how the product intended to purchase will look like.

See the image below:

![Simple Image](./assets/images/product_simple_images.png)

Let us understand this with an example. 

Lets assume that a customer would like to purchase a car. Now, car images need to be loaded in this tab. 

* **Main Image** - The main image will be a general photo image of the car, that has to be uploaded by clicking on the 'Select an image' button and select the appropriate image from the files.

* **Thumbnail Image** - The thumbnail image would be something that represents the original product, but it would be a much smaller one to fit into a button, that will be shown up in the cart. By seeing this, the customer will understand that his product is displayed on the button and will click the button to see more details about the car.

* **Additional Images** - Additional images help the customer to know more details about the car, which will be showing the car view in many angles, and the customer will understand it clearly how it looks like, what the technical details of the car, the colour, and so on.

<a name="shipping"></a>
### Shipping

This tab has the configuration setting for shipping. Any product that has been purchased, has to be shipped to the customer, if the product is physically deliverable.

Consider the image below:

![Simple Shipping](./assets/images/product_simple_shipping.png)

As shown in the image, you need to do the following activities to configure shipping:

* **Enable Shipping** - Select **Yes** to enable shipping
* **Dimensions** - Enter the dimensions of the packed product in **Length x Width x Height**
* **Length Class** - Choose a length class from the list e.g., **cm, mm, inch**, etc.
* **Weight** - Enter the net weight of the product when packed in the field provided
* **Weight Class** - Select the weight class from the list like **Kg, grams, pounds**, etc.


<a name="options"></a>
### Options

In this tab, you can set your preferred options for a particular product like, colour of the product, size of the product, weight of product, mass of the product etc.

See the image on how to set the option for a product.

![Simple Product Options](./assets/images/product_simple_options_1.png)

Once you select the option from the dropdown list, it will be added as you can see in the image below.

![Simple Product Options](./assets/images/product_simple_options.png)

In the image, you have a text field to enter the option name like colour, size etc. Just enter that in the text field. It will be set as preferred option.

If an option is created and set already, you can also import it here rather create a new option. Click the button and it will direct you to the predefined options, if any.

<a name="filters"></a>
### Filters
Filters are certain attributes that help narrow the search of a particular product.

For e.g., assume that a customer searches for purple t-shirts in the store. Now, the productfilter is set as colour > purple, to narrow the search. See the image below:

![Simple Product Filters](./assets/images/product_simple_filters.png)

Now the cart will display only the purple t-shirts.

<a name="relations"></a>
### Relations

Relations are used to promote sales by suggesting the customer with higher value products than the one being looked and additional products to be bought with a particular product.

![Simple Product Relations](./assets/images/product_simple_relations.png)


* In this tab page, relations are set for Upsells and Cross sells
* An ***upsell*** is to get the customer to spend more money – buy a more expensive model of the same type of product considered for purchase.
* A ***cross-sell*** is to get the customer to spend more money buy adding more products from other categories, additionally, along with the product intended for purchase.
* **Example**:
    The terms cross-sell and upsell are often used interchangeably because, let’s face it, this gets confusing. Say the customer is viewing a Laptop with 2GB/500GB for $500.

You can suggest the customer with some options, so that the customer may be convinced to buy one of your options, thus promoting a higher sale for you.

Your suggestions could be like this:

   * 4GB/500GB-> $550 - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * 4GB/1TB -> $700  - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * Laptop Bag -> $25 - Cross sell, related product, additional sell
