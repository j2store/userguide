# Price based per order

The shipping cost in this type is calculated using the price of each item. So, price ranges are predefined and for every price range, a specific shipping cost can be charged.

For example, if the price based calculation set like this:

For order value upto $ 1000, the shipping cost is fixed at $ 30.00 and from $ 1001 to $ 2000, the shipping cost is fixed at $ 25. In this type of shipping method, it may be assumed that as the order value increases, there will be a discount in shipping cost and at a particular threshold, the shipping cost will be fixed at a flat rate.

For e.g., order value > $ 5000, $ 10.00 will be collected as shipping cost. This is an example for understanding purpose only and should not be assumed as real time cost.

Check the image below to understand the shipping method configuration.

Alike the previous methods, the shipping type option has to be set appropriately for this method, as '**Price based per order**'.
