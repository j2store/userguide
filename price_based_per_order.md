# Price based per order

The shipping cost in this type is calculated using the price of each item. So, price ranges are predefined and for every price range, a specific shipping cost can be charged.

For example, if the price based calculation set like this:

For order value upto $ 1000, the shipping cost is fixed at $ 30.00 and from $ 1001 to $ 2000, the shipping cost is fixed at $ 25. In this type of shipping method, it may be assumed that as the order value increases, there will be a discount in shipping cost and at a particular threshold, the shipping cost will be fixed at a flat rate.

For e.g., order value > $ 5000, $ 10.00 will be collected as shipping cost. This is an example for understanding purpose only and should not be assumed as real time cost.
