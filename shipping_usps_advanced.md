**2)Box packing :**

The box packing included with this shipping method lets you pack all the items into single box for which you have to define height, width, length, weight and max-weight. Packing is mainly volume based but also considers item size. ![](./assets/images/Box.png)

If you choose box packing then you will have to create/set box size.The box will have the following fields.

- Name: This allows you to name your custom packages.

- L (in), W (in), H (in): The first set of dimensions are the outer dimensions of the package. These are the dimensions passed to the API. If you are working with a flat rate box via the API (i.e., Regional Boxes), use the API's 'inner dimensions' for your box's outer dimensions. Your box must 'fit' inside.

- Inner L (in), Inner W (in), Inner H (in): The second set of dimensions are for the inner dimensions of the packaging. This should be the outer dimensions minus the thickness of the package walls. These dimensions are used for packing and items must fit within them (they cannot be the same size as the products, allow for a little extra room).

- Weight of Box (lbs): This is the weight of the empty box by itself. This weight is added to the total weight of the contents.

- Max Weight (lbs): This is the maximum weight your box can hold. This includes the weight of the box and the contents.

- Letter: This checkbox determines whether your package is a letter (envelope) or a box.

After configuring the USPS settings, then the important thing you have to do is to enter the dimensions for your product. Refer the image below ![](./assets/images/dimension.png)

**3)Weight Based Packing :**

In this each product has different weight. Product having less than 70 lbs will be packed up into the single pack. If the products exceeds the 70 lbs it does not pack up.

## Advanced package handling

This type of handling method applies to Box packing type and Flat rate services. For scenario, consider you are having only two boxes (Box 1, Box 2) and 7 items needs to be packed. Pack the first three items into Box 1 and second three items into Box 2\. To pack the item 7, you need one more box (Box 3). So you need multiple boxes to pack the items. In this case, you can decide the cost for additonal box should be applied or not.

By this Advance Package handling method you can use the following options to charge and un-charge the unpacked item.

**Unpacked item handling**

  Choosing this option will cancel sending quotes for all the boxes.
