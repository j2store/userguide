##Show J2Store content in Front-end


This section will help you understand how to display the SEBLOD article in front end.

The display can be achieved in the following methods:

* **Category Blog View**
* **Single Article View**
* **Search & List View**

To display SEBLOD articles in the frontend, you need to create a menu exclusively and then you can display it. 

### Category Blog View
Before you proceed to view the article in frontend, you need to check one thing. Go to **Components -> J2Store -> Setup -> Configuration**. Go to **Cart** tab. Now, check the setting of **Add to cart placement** option. Ensure it is selected with **Within article using tag** as shown in the image below.
![](./assets/images/seblod-cat-blog-cart-tab.png)

To achieve front end category blog view, we need to follow a few procedures as explained below:

#### Create a Menu Item
In the backend main menu, go to **Menus -> Main Menu**. You will get the **Main Menu Items** list, as shown in the image below:
![](./assets/images/seblod-menu-items.png)

Click on the ***Add New Menu Item*** or ***New*** button, as pointed out in the image. You will get the screen as shown in the image below: 
![](./assets/images/seblod-create-new-menu-item-1.png)

Enter a name for the new menu item and click on the **Select** button to select the type of the menu item.
![](./assets/images/seblod-create-new-menu-item-2.png)

As shown in the image, click on the **Articles** and you will get a list down the option. From the new list, select **Category Blog**. Now, you will get a new option below the menu item type, named ***Choose a category***. From that option, select **Product** as illustrated in the next image.
![](./assets/images/seblod-create-new-menu-item-3.png)

#### Edit SEBLOD Form Article Content Section
After you have finished, go to **Components -> SEBLOD 3.x** and in the screen that is delivered, choose **Form & Content Type Manager**. It will give you the screen that is shown in the following image:
![](./assets/images/seblod-j2s-frontend-1.png)

As shown in the image, select the **Intro** tab. Select **All App Folders** and locate **J2Store_Cart**. Add it by clicking on the **'<'** symbol. Now, click on the *pencil* symbol to edit the cart options, as shown in the image below:
![](./assets/images/seblod-j2s-frontend-2-new.png)
You can edit the cart options by changing the text in the field as per your wish, for time being **mainimage|cart**. Save the settings.

Now, go to the front end view of the site. You will get the home page as shown below:
![](./assets/images/seblod-cat-blog-view-1-new.png)

Your home page will display the products in your online store. Note that the new menu item, **Category Blog View** you have created is listed in the main menu list. Click on that and you will get the view as shown in the below image:
![](./assets/images/seblod-cat-blog-view-2-new.png)

### Single Article View

To achieve the single article view, follow the steps, as illustrated in the images below:

![](./assets/images/single-article-view-1.png)

As shown in the image, click select the **Form & Content Types** menu. You will get the screen as shown below:

![](./assets/images/single-article-view-2.png)

Click on the **Article** and you will get the settings and configuration of **Article**. Check for the settings as shown in the next image.

![](./assets/images/single-article-view-3.png)

If the settings match the image above, you are done. If there is no ***J2Store_Cart*** listed on the left side, you can create on using the **+** sign on the right side. Now go to the frontend. All the articles will be listed in the site, as shown in the image below:

![](./assets/images/single-article-frontend-1.png)

You will get all the articles listed here. Click on any one article's name, as shown underlined in the image. You will get the single article view.

![](./assets/images/single-article-frontend-2.png)

You can see the additional images, the cart, the **Next** button etc., in the view. If you hover on the additional images, they will be displayed in the main window, with a zoom effect. 

This is how we achieve single article view.

### SEBLOD List & Search Type View

In order to acieve the SEBLOD list and search view, you need to create a new menu item of type list and search. The following images illustrate the procedure.

![](./assets/images/list-view-backend-1.png)

As shown in the image, go to **Menus -> Main Menu -> Add New Menu Item**

You will get the screen to enter the menu items details. Enter a name for the menu item, say **SEBLOD List Articles** and then click on the *Select* button to choose the menu item type. You will get a pop-up window as shown below:

![](./assets/images/list-view-backend-2.png)

Click on **SEBLOD** and you will get a list below. From the list, select **List & Search**. Now you will get a new field below the one you have dealt with just before, as **Search Type(List)**. Choose **Articles** in this field, as shown in the next image. 

![](./assets/images/list-view-backend-3.png)

Leave other fields untouched. The Link will be created automatically. Now, **Save & Close** the menu item. 

Go to frontend of your site.

You can see the menu item **SEBLOD List Articles**. Click on that and you will get the seblod articles listed down. These are depicted with the help of the following images.

![](./assets/images/seblod-list-frontend-1.png)
![](./assets/images/seblod-list-frontend-2.png)
![](./assets/images/seblod-list-frontend-3.png)

When you add the articles to your cart and click on the checkout link, the  frontend of your site will look something like this:

![](./assets/images/checkout-page.png)

You can checkout with a single click. It is not necessary for you to be a registered user. You can checkout as a guest. Later if you want, you can register.

#### Solve introtext displaying twice

Sometimes you may face trouble in displaying short description and long description (i.e.) it displays the introtext twice instead of displaying the introtext and the fulltext.

If you face above issue, please try below solution which will solve your problem.

Copy /components/com_j2store/templates/default/view_ldesc.php

to

/templates/YOUR-TEMPLATE/html/com_j2store/templates/default/view_ldesc.php

Edit the file and replace the content with following code snippet
```php
<?php if($this->params->get('item_show_ldesc', 1)): ?>
	<div class="product-ldesc">
		<?php // echo $this->product->product_long_desc; ?>
	
	<?php 
	// query and extract the full text
	$fulltext = '';
	if ( $product->product_source_id > 0 ) {
		
		$db = JFactory::getDbo();
		$qry = $db->getQuery(true);
		$qry -> select('*') 
			 -> from('#__content')
			 -> where('id='.$product->product_source_id);
		$db->setQuery($qry);
		$item = $db->loadObject();
		$raw_text = '';
		$raw_text = $item->introtext;

		$st = strpos($raw_text,"::fulltext::") + 12 ;
		$len = strpos($raw_text,"::/fulltext::") - $st;
		$fulltext = substr($raw_text, $st, $len );
	}
	
		echo $fulltext;
 	?>

	</div>
<?php endif; ?>
```
