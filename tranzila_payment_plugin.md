##### Testing Information
You may use a dummy number which simulates a ***Visa card*** number – 4444333322221111.

The CVV should be any three digit number, for example - 333.

Another dummy number to simulate ***Isracard*** is 12312312.

Contact **Tranzilla** for more information on test credit cards.

##### Troubleshooting
When submitting an order, J2Store may return an error about

"**Credit cart could not be processed...**" 

This might not necessarily mean it isn't working. 

You can check it in two places:

1) In the **Tranzila** account go to Transactions >> Today >> All, and see if your order was registered. If so, it means it worked ok on your settings are correct. The fact that it didn't return "000" (Payment accepted) as a response. Perform some more test purchases. If the problem persists, contact the **Tranzila** Support.

2) If your order was not registered in your **Tranzila**, then it means wrong settings. Check your server IP and make sure your entered the IP correctly.
