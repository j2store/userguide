### How to Print shipping labels ?

Requesting and printing shipping labels is done from the backend order history page. To get started, you first need to view/edit an order in the backend. From Joomla backend, go to J2Store > Sales > Orders and view/edit an order.

<a name="validate"></a>
#### Validate shipping addresses

Before printing a label the shipping address needs to be verified with USPS.

Click on the button "**Validate**" validates the given shipping address (customer's shipping address) with USPS. If the shipping address is valid, the stamps.com attempts to match the given address and provides you with a formatted address that you can Accept (order is updated).

If Stamps.com could not match address, you can click **continue Anyway** button.

#### Request for rates

After address verification, you need to submit the rate request form.

Here you choose package type, planned ship date, weight and dimensions for the package being shipped. Dimensions are optional, but may be required for more accurate rating.

Fill your required fields and click on **Get Rates** button. A list of matching shipping rates appears:
