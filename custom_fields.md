# Custom Fields

These are created for additional details to be used in checkout processes that involves billing, payment, shipping etc. For instance, 'last name' of a customer is not required for billing but it is required for shipment. So, it is created as a custom field and made to be displayed in shipping address.

There are two types of custom fields, namely, **Core custom fields** and **Non-Core custom fields**.

Custom fields that are in J2Store by default are **Core** custom fields and that are created by users are **Non-Core** custom fields.

Core custom fields can be edited as per users wish but it is not advisable to make changes to **Core** custom fields except changing the name and label of the fields.

The following is a list of **Core** custom fields:

* first_name
* last_name
* address_1
* address_2
* phone_1
* phone_2
* city
* zip
* country
* company
* email
* tax number
* zone_id
* country_id

Apart from these core custom fields, you can create your own custom fields according to your requirements.

For example, if you want to add a custom note for your reference, you can create it as a custom field and make it to be displayed in the billing or shipping process.

    * Textarea
    * wysiwyg editor (what you see is what you get)
    * Radio
    * Checkbox
    * Single Dropdown
    * Zone/Country List
    * Date
    * Time
    * DateTime
    * Custom Text

The remaining fields after the **Field Type** is selected, will be different based on the **Field Type** and the details have to fed as required by the changed fields
* **Required** - Whether the field is required or not - select 'Yes' or 'No'
* **Custom Error Message** - If it is required field and left empty on data entry, this message will be displayed to alert the user
* **Default Value** - What is given here will be the content displayed, if the user do not give any input to the field
* **Input Filtering** - If you want to filter out the input to this field, you can select this to 'Yes' and set the conditions
* **Maximum Length** - The no of characters that are allowed to enter in the field
* **Rows** - No of rows that are allowed in the field
* **Columns** - No of columns that are allowed in the field
* **Read-only** - If it is set to '**Yes**', it is only readable and the content cannot be changed

#### Status
* **Published** - To display the field it has to be published by setting this option to '**Yes**'.

#### Display Settings
You can choose the layouts to display the field. You can select all the three layouts or any combination of layouts or only one layout. The layouts are:
* **Checkout Billing Address Layout**
* **Checkout Shipping Address Layout**
* **Checkout Payment Method Layout**

#### Add the custom field in the checkout layout

To add the custom field into the checkout field,

Go to J2store > setup > configuration > checkout layout

You can find the three layouts (billing address layout, shipping address layout, payment method layout).

Here you can edit the billing and shipping layouts by re-ordering the fields or by adding new fields(custom fields).

For example, if you have created the field called custom_address3 with the selection of billing address layout in custom field display settings and if you want to display it in the checkout layout, add it in the billing layout section in the J2store configuration checkout layout tab.

Field name should be enclosed with square brackets (for example,**[custom_address3]**)
