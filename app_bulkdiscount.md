# Bulk discounts

Encourage customers to purchase more by providing bulk discounts depending on the ordered quantity and on the specific product.

Bulk discounts can be defined at site-wide (globally), category wise or per product wise. Provide a fixed per product discount or percentage of the total purchase. The plugin implements a greater flexibility in providing discounts without requiring the customers to apply a coupon.

You can also restrict the application of the discount depending on the customer groups.
