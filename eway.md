## Configuration - eWay Direct

> Old method. Not recommended by eWay. Consider using the eWay Rapid

**IMPORTANT:** eWay Direct can only handle the Australian Dollor. So you should first set your default Currency is AUD.

**Pay Method:**
eWay offers three types of pay methods.

*Real Time:* Payment will be made realtime without CVV/CVN verification

*Real time with CVN:* Recommended method. This will verify the CVV/CVN value of the card

*GeoIP and Anti-Fraud:* This will send the customer IP address in order to verify the IP and check fraud based on Geolocation.

**Use eWay Sandbox:**
Set this to yes to test your transaction using the Sandbox of eWay. Note: You should use the customer ID given in the sandbox instead of the live one.

**Article for Thanks Msg:**
You can create an article with a custom message and enter its ID here. Customers will see this message after the payment.
