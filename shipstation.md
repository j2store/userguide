Now import your orders and manage shipping on the go with the help of this integration. With Shipstation, you need not worry about shipping your orders using different carriers, cause you can manage everything at a one stop place using this integration.

Shipstation is a multi-channel, multi-carrier shipping solution that simplifies the shipping process for online merchants. Shipstation can be integrated seamlessly with any shipping carrier and channel and your orders can be easily tracked and managed with just few clicks, regardless of the location.

Now conduct your business with more fluidity and transparency with the easy interfacing of shipstation.

>Note: Specifying the tracking id manually in the Shipstation settings and setting up notifications for Order shipped won't work because if the notifications are set up this way, the tracking numbers will not be synchronized with J2Store.
