<a name="basic_settings"></a>
## Basic Settings

Some basic settings need to be done before you proceed. This will be handled by the following options.

 * ***Enable J2Store CSS***
 
    If this option is enabled, J2store loads the **j2store.css** file for customizing the template style. First, this will look in to the template CSS file. If it is not included, then J2Store loads it own **J2Store.css** file.
    >NOTE: Copy the original CSS file from /media/j2store/css/j2store.css to your template's css folder. Otherwise, you will have to style every element from scratch. The original j2store.css will get you started quickly. You can then append / change existing styles
    
* ***Load jQuery UI***
    
    This option is same as the previous one. Here, there are four options available for selection. 
1. **No** -> Do not load jQuery UI
2. **Only Frontend** -> Load jQuery UI for frontend only
3. **Only Backend** -> Load jQuery UI for backend only
4. **Both frontend and backend** -> Load jQuery UI for frontend and backend

* ***Load jQuery UI Localisation for date picker***

     The date picker will be translated in your language when you set this to **YES**.

* ***Load full bootstrap css***

    If the template is loaded with bootstrap, and if the user does not want it to be loaded, the user may choose **NO**, otherwise choose **YES** to load the default Bootstrap CSS packed with **j2store**.
    
* ***Load minimal bootstrap css***

     If your template does not support the bootstrap, you can consider setting this to **YES** to load a minimal bootsrap support. So that your cart, checkout and order history pages looks good.

* ***Who can see 'add to cart'***
 
    This is an option for the user to add his/her product of choice to the cart to proceed for billing. This can be set to be viewed by **'everyone'** or for **'registered users only'**.

* ***Date Format***

    Here one can choose the display format of date from several [available options](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php). 
    
* ***Folder path for digital goods***

    The relative path to the folder with your corresponding files. Eg., **'/media/myfiles/xyz.css'**

<a name="store"></a>
##Store

Configure the address, administrator email and some defaults for your storefront

* ***Default Length Measurement***

    Select the default length measurement in use for any country from the available options. (Centimetre, Inch, Millimetre)

<a name="product"></a>
##Product
These are global parameters for product display. You can override some of these parameters if you are using the J2Store's product layout.

* ***Catolog Mode***

    Setting this option to **'Yes'** will disable all the features of the cart except the 'price' of the product.

* ***Show SKU?***

    SKU stands for **Stock Keeping Unit**. If this option is set to **'No'**, the SKU will become hidden in both product and cart views.
    
>CAUTION: SKU Show/Hide setting can be done in two places, i.e., in configuration setup and in product layout. Product layout setting will be given higher priority, i.e., if SKU is set to **Show** in configuration and again it is set to **Hide** in product layout, the configuration setting will be overridden and the SKU will be set to **Hide** as it is in product layout. As a result, SKU will not be shown in frontend.   
    
* ***Manufacturer/Brand***

    If it is set to '**YES**', the manufacturer name will be visible.
    
* ***Show Quantity Field***

    If it is set to 'Yes', the manual input for quantity will be visible, else quantity can not be given manually.
    
    
* ***Show Price***

    To hide the price of a product, set this option to **'No'**.
    
* ***Show Base/Regular Price***

    If advanced pricing option is used, i.e., a discount is offered on base price, it can be displayed using this option by setting it to **'Yes'**. It will show the base price in **~~strikedout~~** format.
    
Example:
In J2Store we can set the base price for the product and we can also offer some discount on base price. This discount on baseprice is called advanced price. If this option is **Enabled**(set to 'Yes'), it will show the base price in strikedout format and display the advanced price. 

Lets assume that the base price of a product is $ 300.00 and it is offered a discount of $ 50.00, then the new price will be $ 250.00

It will be displayed as below:

~~$ 300.00~~ (This is the base price)

$ 250.00 (This is the advanced price)

* ***Product Option Price***

    If this option is set to **'Show'**, product option price will displayed along with the option name.

* ***Product Option Price Prefix***

This option will work only when the previous option is enabled.

Setting this option to **'Show'**, will show the prefix for price modifier. i.e., a modifier '+/-' will be shown in the view, to modify the product price.

> Note: The options, ***Product Option Price*** and ***Product Option Price Prefix***, are applicable to **Simple** and **Configurable** product types only and not for **Variable** and **Downloadable** product types.
 
* ***Show Image for Product Options***
    
    This will be applicable for radio button option only. Setting this will show an image near the options in products page.
    
* ***No of columns for related products (upsells & cross sells)***

    This will be used for up-sells and cross-sells display layout when you use the shortcode for displaying up-sells and cross-sells in your article layouts.

<a name="inventory"></a>
# Inventory
***This is a J2Store PRO feature***

* ***Enable Inventory***

    Set this option to **'Yes'** to enable inventory management. Provide the available quantity when a product is added and it will be kept in track whenever an order is processed. Upon successful completion of an order, the ordered product quantity will be deducted from the available quantity and the result will be the new available quantity and when available quantity for a particular product becomes zero, the add to cart button will be disabled. Also, the user cannot enter a quantity greater than available quantity.
    
* ***Cancel New/Pending orders to release stock***

    Enabling this option by setting it to **'Yes'** will cancel the orders with status **'Pending' / 'New'**, if they were not confirmed within the stipulated time, and the stock will be released and added to available quantity.

* ***Hold stock for (in minutes) before canceling***

    If the previous option is set to yes, this option will be enabled for entering the allowed time for order confirmation, else, it will stay disabled.

### Example to add a custom field
Assume that it would be better to add a **Title** field before the **First Name**. To achieve that, create a custom field with *title* as its name, as shown in the image:

![](./assets/images/custom-field-creation.png)

After that, the custom field has to be added to the layout settings in configuration. Go to **J2Store -> Setup -> Configuration** and select **Checkout Layout** tab.Then add the tag for the newly created custom field in the position of the desired display area. Save and close.  Check the image below:

![](./assets/images/add-cus-field-to-layout.png)

Now, in the checkout process, the added custom field **Title** will be displayed before the **First Name** field, as illustrated in the following image:

![](./assets/images/custom-field-in-frontend.png)

In this way, new custom fields can be added according to the needs of the user.

<a name="order"></a>
## Order

* ***Invoice Prefix***

    This is the prefix of the Invoice generated when payment is done. For e.g., the system generates only numbers and if one wants to add some prefix to the invoice number to add information about the invoice, it can be done by setting this field with the prefix.
    * Let's assume a company with a name RB Corporation, sells some products and the invoice prefix can be anything customized by the owner of the company. Some of the possibilities are:
        * **RBC/S/000**
        * **RBC-2015-S-000**

In the above example, **RBC/S/000**, ***RBC*** is the initials of the company, ***S*** can be added for sales classification, ***000*** for number prefix.

Likewise, in ***RBC-2015-S-000***, all are same and the extra 2015 may be added for the sales for the year ***2015***.

Now the system generated invoice number, say 1, will be appended with this prefix, and will be displayed as **RBC/S/0001** in the invoice.

For a better understanding, check the image below.
![Order Configuration](./assets/images/order.png)

* ***Show Link to Order History after payment***
    
    Enabling this will show the user a link which will take to the user's order history page. This will be done only after payment.
    
* ***Downloads tab in My Profile***

     Set this to **SHOW** will display the download tab in the myprofile section.
     
* ***Customers can see orders with the status of***

     All, Confirmed,Processed,Failed,Pending,New,Cancelled
     
*  ***Product Thumbnail image in email template***

	Set this to **SHOW** will display the product thumbnail image in email template.
