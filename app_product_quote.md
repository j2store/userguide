#### Layout

If you would like to add / remove the fields in product quote form without affecting checkout form fields, it is possible in this section.

In this section, you can create the custom form by adding field shortcode given in the top of the layout tab page and display that field in the form.

To add any new fields, go to J2Store > Setup > Custom fields. Click NEW to create new field.

Enter the label name, field name, choose field type and set the status to **Published**.

If you don't want to display this new field in checkout and wants to display it only in product quote form, then in custom field display settings, set **NO** to all layouts (Checkout billing address layout, Checkout shipping address layout, Checkout payment method layout).

Now, in form layout add the shortcodes of fields you want to display in product quote form. To add the custom field shortcode, copy the field name in J2Store > Setup > Custom fields section and paste it in the form. The field name should be enclosed with square braces. For example, [message].
