#### How CB Profile Synch works ?

If user has already entered an address during Profile creation in Community Builder, this app will synchronize all the required profile details during checkout. Clicking on one single button will make everything easy.
**Step-1**
Go to J2Store > Dashboard > Apps and open CB Profile Synchronous app

**Step-2**
On opening app, the page will list down the available users who are registered newly.

On top right of that page, you will be having large green coloured button named with CB Profile Synchronize. Clicking on that button will synchronize the users details with J2Store. Refer the screenshots below

**Step-3**
Now go to your store front and add the item into the cart -> proceed checkout -> Login.

Usually, if new user login first time at J2Store checkout page, in the next step Billing address will ask you to enter your address and personal information. But with CB Profile synchronous, the address will be synchronized from community builder and no need to re-enter everything. Refer the screenshots below
