# Weight based per Order - Example

To create a shipping method of type **Weight based per Order**, follow the steps given below:

> Assume that you have a store in California, USA. You will get orders from all over USA. You need to ship the consignment to the customer, with shipping rate based on weight of items per order. Let us see how a **Weight based per order** shipping method can be created for your store.

For a better understanding, consider this:

Your shop is in California, US. For shipping within California, a separate geozone is created for California and the shipping charges will be as levied as follows, provided the **minimum** quantity eligible for shipping is 50 Kgs. The below table shows the weight and the corresponding shipping charges.

| Weight (In Kilograms - Kg) | Rate (In USD - $) |
| -- | -- |
| 50 - 250 | 25 |
| 251 - 500 | 35 |
| 501 - 1000 | 50 |

Like this, you can set different rates for shipping outside California, by creating different geozones and fixing different shipping rates, based on the distances of the locations from California, as given below:

| Weight (In Kilograms - Kg) | Philadelphia Rate (In USD - $) | Texas Rate (In USD - $) | New Jersey Rate (In USD - $) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 50 - 250 | 30 | 40 | 45 |
| 251 - 500 | 40 | 50 | 50 |
| 501 - 1000 | 50 | 60 | 65 |
