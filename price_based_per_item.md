# Price based per item

The shipping cost in this type of method is calculated with price of the individual items. Some price range may be set for cost calculation and it will be followed.

Say for example, if a product or item falls under the price range of $ 100 to 1000, a shipping cost of $ 50.00 may be charged and if the item falls under the range of $ 1001 to $ 2000, the shipping cost may be fixed at $ 40.00 and so on.

For configuration of this shipping method, refer the image below.
