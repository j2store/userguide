# Basic Settings

Some basic settings need to be done before you proceed. This will be handled by the following options.

 * ***Enable J2Store CSS***
 
    If this option is enabled, J2store loads the **j2store.css** file for customizing the template style. First, this will look in to the template CSS file. If it is not included, then J2Store loads it own **J2Store.css** file.

* ***Load jQuery***
***(Only for joomla 2.5)***
    
    If your template or your extensions load jQuery by default and you do not want jQuery to be loaded, then you can avoid it by choosing *NO* in this option. Otherwise, you can load jQuery either locally or from a remote area, for eg. google.com
    
* ***Load jQuery UI***
    
    This option is same as the previous one. Here, there are four options available for selection. 
1. **No** -> Do not load jQuery UI
2. **Only Frontend** -> Load jQuery UI for frontend only
3. **Only Backend** -> Load jQuery UI for backend only
4. **Both frontend and backend** -> Load jQuery UI for frontend and backend

* ***Load Bootstrap***
 ***(Only for joomla 2.5)***

    If the template is loaded with bootstrap, and if the user does not want it to be loaded, the user may choose **NO**, otherwise choose **YES** to load the default Bootstrap CSS packed with **j2store**.

* ***Who can see 'add to cart'***
 
    This is an option for the user to add his/her product of choice to the cart to proceed for billing. This can be set to be viewed by **'everyone'** or for **'registered users only'**.

* ***Date Format***

    Here one can choose the display format of date from several [available options](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php). 
    
* ***Folder path for digital goods***

    The relative path to the folder with your corresponding files. Eg., **'/media/myfiles/xyz.css'**
