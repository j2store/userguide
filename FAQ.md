<a name="product_options_not_working"></a>
#### Product Options not working or displaying option

This problem may happen due to Jquery.
Check your j2store basic settings tab in Joomla admin->J2store->setup->configuration.
You might have set Load jQuery UI to only frontend.It should be always in Both frontend and backend.

**[Video tutorial](https://youtu.be/AA9cLYTuXZE)**

<a name="vat_not_appears_in_checkout"></a>
#### Vat not appears in check out

In Configuration - Tax, tax is set to be applied on the shipping address
In the tax profile, it is set to apply billing address.

<a name="donation_plugin_empty"></a>
#### Donation plugin is empty.Why

The donation app adds a Donation option type.
So go to j2store - catalog - options
Create an option. Choose the option type as donation
Save.

Open your product (simple should work good)
go to J2Store Cart - Options
Search for the donation option you just created.
Add it and save.

<a name="multiplestores_differentnotification_depending_oncategory"></a>
#### Multiple stores / different notification receiver depending on category

J2Store is a B2C solution where you can maintain only one store.
It does not support multi-store system. 
As a result, when an order is placed, all the store administrators will be notified.

If you just want the email notifications to be controlled and made dependent on the category, 
then a custom app could be developed that will send email for the party concerned.

<a name="new_line_character"></a>
#### New Line Characters (\r\n) in Checkout form

Go to Joomla admin - J2Store - Configuration - Checkout Layout
Click the Populate/re-set button and Save

<a name="shipping_not_working"></a>
#### Shipping Not Working

Make sure about two things
1.Setting under J2Store > Configuration > Store > Weight Unit
![alt tag](./assets/images/faq_shipping.png)

2.Setting under Edit Product > shipping tab

* Enable shipping.
* The configured shipping rates with shipping rates does has an entry with matching rate.
For eg: In case the item has 829 grams, you have to configure a rate between 800 and 1000 and the estimate shipping lists the rate.

<a name="order_listed_without_payment"></a>
#### Why the order is listed in the backend even didnt make a payment? How to see the paid products?

The purpose of the order status column is to differentiate between the new, paid, pending orders.
If the order status is NEW, then no payment has been made.

If you do not like the word NEW, you can change it. Go to J2Store - Localisation - Order status.
Edit NEW and change it to something like UNPAID

**Why the order is listed in the backend :**

When customer reaches the last step of Checkout, we have to save the data as the order. Because, when he clicks Place order, he will be redirected to PayPal. That also means we will lose the data if we did not save. 
So J2Store saves the order as NEW.

When a payment is succesfully made, the order status will be set to CONFIRMED.
So by looking at the order status, you can differentiate which orders are paid which are not.

There is a marketing opportunity as well. You can follow up with the unpaid customers and convert them.

<a name="layout_problem"></a>
#### Grid layout not working/columns.Why?

The issue seems to be the wrong sub-template. Open your product list layout menu. In Common options tab -> set the sub-template as Bootstrap3. Save

This should solve the issue. If it is already set to Bootstrap 3, then try to set it as Default.

<a name="avoid_mouseover"></a>

<a name="remove_thumbnail"></a>
#### Remove Thumbnail image

* Open the plugin and goto the Item view tab.
* Set Display image to No.

<a name="text_after_tax"></a>
#### How to display the tax information(Incl. 19% tax) with follow text have to be linked to a several page?

##### Step-1 Enable tax information to be displayed on product page

Go to J2Store -> Configuration - Tax settings
Set Display tax information below the prices (in product pages) to YES.
See the screenshot below

![](./assets/images/tax_including_text.png)

It would display a text like this: (Incl. XX% tax )

This might be in English.

You can change this with a language override for below language constant
Language constant is: J2STORE_PRICE_INCLUDING_TAX

##### Step-2 Creating language override

Go to Extensions -> Language(s) -> select Overrides.

Choose your language(For example, English(en-GB-Administrator)) in filter section and click new on top left.

Add J2STORE_PRICE_INCLUDING_TAX in Language constant text box.

In Text box, add **Inkl %s MwSt (add the link using html anchor tag)**. For example, 
```html
Inkl %s MwSt. <a href="yoursite.com">See more</a>
```

Check For both locations.

Location should be administrator.

Save and close.

Here is a screenshot showing the language override

<a name="payment-options"/>
## [WHY] payment options are not showing at checkout payment method step

Please go to J2Store -> Set up - payment methods
Open the payment methods you are using.
And make sure the Geozone field is set to All

And make sure your order total (cart total ) is above zero. If it is zero, payment methods wont be necessary at the checkout.

Go to J2Store -> Configuration -> Orders

Now customers will only be able to see the orders that has the selected statuses.

For example, if you selected Confirmed status alone, then only orders that has the confirmed status will show up.
