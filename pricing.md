As illustrated in the image, you can set the regular price by entering the value in the text box. If you want advanced pricing, click the '**Set Prices**' button and it will open up a pop-up window to allow you to set an advanced price setting.

Let us see how it happens. Check the image below:

* Select the dates, between which you wish to set the advanced price. *This option is not mandatory. For instance, you can offer a special price throughout the year, for a bulk purchase.* 

* Then enter the minimum quantity required to avail this special price. This is also optional and if there is no minimum quantity required, just leave it as empty.

* Select the customer group to which you offer this special price.

* Now enter the new price and click **Create**.

The price will be added and displayed below. You can edit that if you need, and click **Save all prices**.

If you want to remove that, you can do it by clicking the **Remove** button.
