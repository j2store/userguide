# Simple CSV Import and Export

The app helps you import products from a CSV file. 

#### Important instructions before using this app

1. **Backup your site** - 
Before you tend to use this app for import / export operations, you **MUST** be careful enough to take a full backup of your site. Use Akeeba backup to take the backup.

2. **Export once** - 
Export your products into .csv format once, to see how the format looks like. Check for field names. They should match. 

3. **Importing New Products** - 
If you want to import new products, then you can ignore the product_id field. And just make sure your products have a unique SKU. If an existing product has the same SKU as your new product, then the app will only update the existing product instead of creating a new one. 

4. **Unique SKU**
    1. SKU of the products **MUST** be unique. If there is a duplicate, it will result in an error.
    2. The app depends on SKU to find a product. So, if an SKU is found when searched, the existing product will be updated with the imported product details. If a match is not found, a new product will be created with the SKU. 

5. Refer the documentation on exporting your <a target="_blank" href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba">Excel file as CSV</a>

6. Support for importing product options and / or product variants are not available.

### Parameters

1. **Choose Import Type** - 
You can choose to upload a CSV file or point the app to locate the file in a path. Recommended setting is: Upload.

2. **Upload the CSV file** - 
Click on the *Browse* button to select the CSV file for uploading.

3. **Character Set** -
If you are not sure about the charter set of your file or do know what it is, then it is safe to leave it as **Not Known**. The app will attempt to determine the character set.

4. **Update product if SKU already exists** -
If set to **Yes**, it will update existing products, if the SKU matches. Setting this to **NO** will only create new products. 

5. **Export Products** -
Clicking this button will export your products in csv format.
