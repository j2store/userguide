On opening the app, you will be having the following options:
**Function type:** Here you have to choose the functional type of app. Choosing **NO** will hide the product visibility to the countries selected. Choosing **YES** will make the product visible to the countries you selected.

**Hide the product for countries in the selected geozones:** This option is used to choose which part of the product should be hidden in store front. You can hide either entire product or hide only the add to cart button. There is one more option in the dropdown which will show the entire product but block the cart function(customer from the selected country cannot add the item into the cart).
